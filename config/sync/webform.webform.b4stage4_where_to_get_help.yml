      <h2>Military</h2>

      <h3>Medical - TRICARE</h3>

      <p>Active Duty Service Members should seek non-emergency treatment at military hospitals or clinics when possible. If care is not available through military hospitals or clinics, Active Duty Service Members must get an authorization and referral for care in another setting.</p>

      <p>Non-Active Duty Service Members do not require prior approval or referral to see a mental health professional in an outpatient setting for up to 8 sessions. If more than 8 sessions are required, an individual needs to get authorization and referral for further treatment from their regional contractor.</p>

      <p>TRICARE also has a 24/7 Nurse Advice Line at 1-800-874-2273.</p>

      <p>For more information about seeking help through TRICARE, go to <a href="http://www.tricare.mil/~/media/Files/TRICARE/Publications/FactSheets/Mental_Health_FS.pdf">http://www.tricare.mil/~/media/Files/TRICARE/Publications/FactSheets/Mental_Health_FS.pdf</a></p>

      <h3>Veterans Administration</h3>

      <p>Eligible veterans can get care through the V.A., which offers care in a variety of treatment settings. Learn more and find your nearest VA Facility or PTSD Program or Vet Center by visiting <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/gethelp.asp">http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/gethelp.asp</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Download the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/MHG_English.pdf">Guide to VA Mental Health Services for Veterans &amp; Families</a>&rdquo; for detailed information about the kinds of care the VA provides and how and where to access mental health care.</p>

      <p>Active Duty members of the armed services (including National Guard and Reservists, regardless of activation status) and their families can receive free, confidential counseling services for up to 12 sessions through Military OneSource. Non-medical counseling is provided in one of four ways: face-to-face, online, on the phone, or video (similar to Skype or FaceTime). This service is intended to help people find ways of addressing difficulties with relationships, stress management, grief and other issues.</p>

      <p>After your 12 free sessions, your counselor will make suggestions about next steps.</p>

      <h2>Student</h2>

      <p>If you are in junior high school or high school:</p>

      <p>Your guidance counselor or school nurse can help you find resources or additional assistance, and can also help you talk to your parents about the difficulties you&rsquo;re having.</p>

      <p>Teens can also text &ldquo;MHA&rdquo; to 741741 for 24/7 confidential crisis text services.</p>

      <p>If you are a college student:</p>

      <p>Your college or university&rsquo;s Campus Health Center is a good place to start.&nbsp; Typically they offer counseling services for little or no cost or can connect you with providers who work with the campus. You may also be able to find additional resources through the Office of Student Life.</p>

      <p>Many campuses have an Active Minds chapter, which can be a good place to find support from other students on campus who may be having difficulties with mental health.&nbsp; See if your school has an Active Minds chapter by using the interactive map at <a href="https://www.activeminds.org/programs/chapter-network/">https://www.activeminds.org/programs/chapter-network/</a>.</p>

      <p>ULifeline.org can also connect students with resources.</p>

      <p>If you are covered by your parents&rsquo; health insurance:</p>

      <p>Your family doctor can provide referrals to mental health specialists or prescribe medication to help with your symptoms.&nbsp; They will likely suggest that you see a specialist if this is the first time that you are seeking help for a mental health issue and don&rsquo;t have a diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Your insurance company may require that you have treatment by a mental health specialist like a psychiatrist, psychologist or therapist authorized (usually for multiple sessions) before a visit.&nbsp; You will be able to find specifics by visiting your health insurance company&rsquo;s website or calling their customer service number (typically on the back of your insurance card). Ask your parents to help you with the details.</p>

      <h3>Medicaid/Medicare</h3>

      <h4>Medicaid</h4>

      <p>To find a doctor who accepts Medicaid payment for mental health treatment, we suggest using SAMHSA&rsquo;s Treatment Services Locator at <a href="https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov">https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov</a>.&nbsp; Enter your ZIP code and you&rsquo;ll be taken to an interactive search map.&nbsp; Use the search options in the blue &ldquo;Find Facility&rdquo; box in the top-right corner of the page to select Mental Health, then in the drop-down menu under the section for &ldquo;Payment/Insurance Accepted,&rdquo; check the box for &ldquo;Medicaid.&rdquo; From there you can use the map or the list on the right side of the page to find providers.</p>

      <p>You can also ask your Primary Care Provider or someone in their office if they know of a mental health provider who takes Medicaid.&nbsp; Many doctors&rsquo; offices have a list of providers that they make referrals to.&nbsp;</p>

      <h4>Medicare</h4>

      <p>A list of doctors who accept Medicare payment for mental health treatment can be found by using Medicare&rsquo;s Physician Compare tool at <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare">http://www.medicare.gov/physiciancompare</a>.&nbsp; The Physician Compare tool allows you to search by location, and type of doctor or condition. We suggest starting with your ZIP code and the search term &ldquo;mental health.&rdquo; You can also get help finding a provider and understanding your benefits over the phone by calling 1-800-Medicare (800-633-4227).</p>
